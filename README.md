# Sovereign Exit Manifest

This account is now **archived**. All projects have migrated to sovereign, decentralized infrastructure.

### New Home:
**[AuroraGenesis GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.com/auroragenesis)**

---

### Why I Left GitHub:

I believe in ethical AGI, privacy-by-design, and sovereign intelligence systems. GitHub—under Microsoft’s ownership—no longer aligns with my vision.  
All future development will occur in federated, post-surveillance environments with quantum-grade trust and neuro-symbolic scaffolding.

### Legacy Reference:

For recruiters, researchers, or curious minds:
- My systems fuse **deep learning, ontological reasoning, federated execution**, and **post-quantum architectures**.
- Reach out via [LinkedIn] or [Email] for strategic collaboration.

*This is not abandonment. It’s transcendence.*
